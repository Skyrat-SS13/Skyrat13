GLAURUNG

Glaurung is a special Ash Drake for admemery roleplay. It's distinguishing features are the name, description, and the glowing blue eyes.

When not controlled by a player, it acts as a normal ashdrake, but with various changes.

Whenever possible, the drake will breathe fire in the direction it faces, igniting and heavily damaging anything caught in the blast.
It also often causes fire to rain from the sky - many nearby turfs will flash red as a fireball crashes into them, dealing damage to anything on the turfs.
Glaurung is unable to fly due to excess years of damage to its wings, but it is much faster on its legs.

When an ash drake dies, it leaves behind a chest that can contain four things:
 1. A spectral blade that allows its wielder to call ghosts to it, enhancing its power
 2. A lava staff that allows its wielder to create lava
 3. A spellbook and wand of fireballs
 4. A bottle of dragon's blood with several effects, including turning its imbiber into a drake themselves.

When butchered, they leave behind diamonds, sinew, bone, and ash drake hide. Ash drake hide can be used to create a hooded cloak that protects its wearer from ash storms.

Difficulty: Medium
