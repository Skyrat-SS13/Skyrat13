  - rscadd: "Adds Orvi-like sprites for Fed uniform and for now on will be default, now known as Planetary Federation's (hopefully not being attached to lore). TOS-era uniform is now placed under reskin option."
  - rscadd: "Service and civilian roles get their own color-coded Orvi-like Fed uniform. TOS/TMP-era is now placed under reskin option too."
  - tweak: "\"Fed utility uniform, enlist\" is now renamed to \"Fed uniform, classic\" for loadout. Somewhat same with Fed (movie) uniform jacket, except it is renames item name itself (making modern lose it's \"modern\" title). Modern fed uniform jacket now allows the same items for it's suit storage as classic one."
