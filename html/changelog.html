				<li class="rscadd">Pipe dispenser to toxins. You now don't need to rush Aux Base roundstart, pester Engineering or hack the science autolathe. Pipe dispensers are almost never used, so unused content is used.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Nanite programming room for science. It's small and needs upgrading.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A bed and a windows that can be toggled to block sight for privacy. Your naked body shouldn't be oogled by the entire department and everyone in it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Goddamned clothing vendors into cloning because LRP man bad. Some excellent roleplaying opportunities for people who use cloning.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New monkey pen for genetics that makes more sense. Cuffing animals to beds will scare the shit out of them and add extra variables into test results that will affect the outcome of some tests.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New Aft and Starboard Quarter Maintenance rooms as science has been moved around a lot, featuring: Ghetto Botany that actually makes sense! No dirt piles on plating. Circuit board room, it's just full of mostly useless and completely harmless circuit boards. This room serves as the DIY room I added on Box, just without the APC. A distro refilling station.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Clone office is now in arrivals.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rebuilt Research Director's office.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rebuilt robotics. The surgery room has been significantly improved. It's a more sombre and private experience.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rebuilt science break room. It now has a small changing room and a seating area so people can actually take breaks.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rebuilt cloning. Looks significantly better. It's roomier and has privacy options. The extra space given will help significantly with organising when there's a huge pile-up of corpses to be cloned. Extra space is given for extra cloning pods.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rebuilt genetics; genetics desk has been removed as it's absolutely pointless and is never used. Instead, genetics is wider and encompasses the desk.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rebuilt arrivals bathroom to be a species segregated bathroom. It's nicer.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slight modification to prison loot for minor ghetto chem potential.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Inconsistent decals in security.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Station ruins areas are now in appropriate locations.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Blast doors in some windows where they don't belong. Toxins keeps their blast doors because, well, it's toxins.</li>
